# Cookiecutter RichTyper

A cookiecutter package for building [Typer-based CLI](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) tools with [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) integration. The development environment is based on [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

Additionally, this template uses [Pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) with [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) support. 

A lot of the additional code are my own preferences but are easily removed or changed if you don't like them.
